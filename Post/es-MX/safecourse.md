# Leading SAFe

En este post mensionare lo que vi en parte del curso de SAFe  para la certificacion SA. para mi experiencia en el curso ver mi otro post [<http://aquí>][mipost]

Tambien tratere de evitar exponer cualquier cosa que no sea debida acerca del curso, por ejemplo publicar el material. Pondre referencias al final del POST.

> Si no conoces los principios de Agile, Scrum o Kanban omite este post podria confundirte mas

> Existen muchos acronimos, por lo que siempre los pondre acompañado de su significada, pero si quieres la lista completa ve al final del articulo

## Cosas a conciderar antes de ir a que es SAFe

Recuerda un Agile Team mas alto nivel utiliza diferentes terminos, algunas palabras se parecen y manejan similitudes pero no es lo mismo, no es lo mismo un EPIC de Scrum que una EPIC en el portafolio de SAFe.

Product Owner y Product Managment no son lo mismo ambos actuan a diferente nivel

## Organigrama

Al estar viendo Scaled Agile es bueno tener un buen concepto de donde estan cada una de los roles en la empresa y identificar quien se comunica con quien.

Un Dev no tiene comunicacion directa con el Product Managmente, hablando en cuestion de desiciones claro, tal vez para detalles menor exista esta comunicacion. pero no confundir.

## General

Siempre que aprendo algo nuevo intento buscar como esta en el mercado, asi que voy a google y youtube para ver cuales son los primero resultados, si la comunidad es muy pequeña me hace pensar que posiblemente algo anda mal.

Para el caso de SAFe me fue diferente mi criterio, primero esta enfocada a organizaciones grandes, quiere decir que no lo veras en una comunidad.

# GLOSARIO

* Agile Architecture:
  Agigle Architecture is a set of values and practices that support the active evolution of the design and architurecture of a system while implementing new system capabilities.

* Agile Release Train (ART):
  The Agile Release Train is a long-lived team of Agile teams, which, along with other stakeholders, develops and delivers solutions icrementally, using a series of fixed-length iterations within a Program Increment (PI) timebox. The ART aligns  team to a common business and technology mission.

* Agile Team: 
  The SAFe Agile Team is a cross-functional group of 5 to 10 people who have the ability and authority to define, build and test some element of Solution value-all in a short Iteration timebox. Specifically, the SAFe Agile Team incorporates the Dev Team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner roles.

* Achitectural Runway:
  The Architectural Runway consists of the existing code, components, and technical infrastructure needed to implement near-term features without excessive redesign and delay

* Built-In Quality:
  Build-In Quality practices ensure that each Solution element, at every increment, meets appropriate quality standards throughout development.

* Business Owners:
  Business Owners are a small group of stakeholders who have the primary business abd techinical responsibility for governance, compilance, and return on investment (ROI) for a Solution developed by an Agile Release Train (ART). They are key stakeholders on the ART who must evaluate fitness for use and actively participate in certain ART events.

* CapEx and OpEx:
  Capital Expenses (CapEx) and Operating Expenses (OpEx) describe Lean-Agile financial accounting practices in a Value Stream budget. In some cases, CapEx may include capitalized labor associated with the devlopment of intangible assets--such as software, intellectual property, and patents.

* Capabilities:
  A Capability is a higher-level solution behavior that typically spans multiples ARTs. Capabilities are sized and split into multiple features to facilitate their implementation in a single PI.

* Communities of Practice (CoPs):
  Communities of Practices (CoPs) are organized groups of people who have a common interest in a specific technical or business domain. They collabora te regularly to share information, improve their skills, and actively work on advancing the general knowledge of domain.

* Compliance:
  Compliance refers to a strategy and a set of activities and artifacts that allow team to apply Lean-Agile development methods to build systems that have the highest possible quality, while simultaneously assuring they meet any regulatory, industry, or other relevant standards.

* Continuous Delivery Pipeline:
  The Continuous Delivery Pipeline (also referred to as 'pipeline') represebts the workflows, activities, and automation needed to provide a continuous release of value to the end user.

* Continuous Deployment (CD):
  Continuous Deplyment (CD) is the process that takes validated Features from Continuos Integration and deploys them into the production environment, where they are tested and readied for rlease. It is the third element in the four-part Continuous Delivery Pipeline of Continuous Expliration (CE), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment, and Release on Demand.

* Continuous Exploration (CE):
  Continuos Exploration (CE) is the process of continually exploring the market and user needs, and defining a Vision, Roadmap, and set of Features that addess those needs. It's the first element in the four-part Continuos Delivery Pipeline, proceding Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), and Release on Demand.

* Continuous Integration (CI):
  Continuos Integration (CI) is the process of taking features from the Program Backlog and developing, testing, integratingm and validating them in a staging environment where they are ready for deployment and release.

* Core Values:
  The four Core Values of alignment, build-in quality, transparency , and program execution represent the fundamental beliefs that are key to SAFe's effectiveness. These guiding principles help dictate behavior and action for everyone who participates in a SAFe portfolio.

* Customers:
  Customers are the ultimate buyer of every SOlutions. They are an integral part of the Lean-Agile development process and Value Stream and have specific responsabilities in SAFe.

* Dev Team:
  The Dev Team is a subset of the Agile Team. It consists of the dedicated professionals who can develop and test a Story, Feature, or component. the Dev Team typically includes software developers and testers, engineers, and other dedicated specialests required to compelte a vertical slice of functionality.

* DevOps:
  DevOps is mindset, a culture, and a set of technical practices. It provides communication, integration, automation, and close cooperation among all the people needed to plan, develop, test, deploy, release, and maintain a Solution.

* Develop on Cadence
  Develop on Cadence is an essential method for managing the inherent variability of system development in a flow-based system, by making sure important events and activities occur on a regular predictable schedule.

* Economic Framework
  The Economic Framework is a set of desicion rules that align everyone to the financial objectives of the Solution and guides the economic decision-making process. It contains four primary constructs: Lean Budgets, Epci funding and governancem decentralized decisioj-making, and job sequencing based on the Cost of Delay (CoD).

* Enables:
  Enablers support the activities needed to extend the Architectural Runway to provide future businnes functionality. These include exploration, infrastructure, compliance, and architecture development. They are captured in the various bkaclogs and occur at all levels of the framework.

* Enterprise:
  The Enterprise represents the business entity to which each SAFe portafilio belongs.

* Epic:
  An Epic is a container for a Solution development initiative large enough to require analysism the dinifition of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and financial approval prior to implemntation occurs over multiple Program Increments (PIs) and follows the Lean startup 'build-measure-lean- cycle.

* Epic Owners:
  Epic Owners are reponsible for coordination portfolio Epics through the Portafolio Kanban system. They define the epic, its Minimum Viable Product (MVP), and Lean business case, and when approved, facilitate implementation.

* Essential SAFe configuration:
  The Essential SAFe configuration is the heart of the Framework and is the simplest starting point for implementation, It's the basic building block for all other SAFe configurations and describes the most critical elements needed to realize the majority of the Framework's benefits.

* Feature:
  A Feature is a service that fulfills a stakeholders need. Each feature includes a benefit hypothesis and acceptance criteria, and is sized or split as necessary to be delivered by a single Agile Release Train (ART) in Program Increment (PI).

* Foundation:
  The Foundation contains the supporting principles, values, mindset, implementation guidance, and leadership roles needed to deliver value successfully at scale.

* Full SAFe configuration
  The Full SAFe configuration is the most comprehensive version of the Framework. It supports enterprises that build and maintain large integrated solutions, which require hundreds of people of more, and includes all levels of SAFe, team, program, large solution, and portfolio. In the larges enterprises, multiple instance of various SAFe configurations may be required.

* Innovation and Planing Iteration
  The Innovation and Planning (IP) Iteration occurs very Program Increment (PI) and servers multiple purposes. It acts as an estimating buffer for meeting PI Objectives and provides dedicated time for innovation, continuing education, PI Planning, and Inspect and Adapt (I&A) events.

* Iteration:
  Iteration are the basic building blocks of Agile development. Each iteration is a standard, fixed-length timebox, where Agile Teams deliver incremental value in the form of working, tested software and system. The recommen

* Iteration Execution:
  Iteration Execution is how Agile Teams manage their work throughout the iteration timebox, resulting in a hight-quality, working, tested system increment.
  
* Iteration Goal:
  Iteration Goals are a high-level summary of the business and technical goals that the Agile Team agrees ti accomplish in an iteration. They are vital to coordinating an Agile Release Train (ART) as a selft-organizing, selft-managing team of teams.

* Iteration Planning:
  Iteration Planning is an event where all team members determine how mucho of the Team Backlog they can commit to delivering during an upcoming Iteration. The team summarizes the work as a set of committed Iteration Goals.

* Iteration Retrospective:
  The Iteration Retrospective is a regular meeting where Agile Team members discuss the result of the Iteration, ewview their practices, and identify ways to improve.

* Iteration Review
  The Iteration Review is a cadence-based event, where each team inspects the increment at the end of every Iteration to asses progress, and then adjusts its backlog for the next iteration.

* Large Solution Level:
  The Large Solution Level contains the roles, artifacts, and processes needed to build large and complex solutions. This includes a stronger focus on capturing requirements in Solution Intent, the coordination of multiple Agile Release Trains (ARTs) and Suppliers, and the need to ensure complience with regulations and standards.

* Large Solutions SAFe configuration
  The Large Solution SAFe configuration is for developing the larges and most complex solutions that typacally require multiple Agile release trains and Suppliers, but do not require portfolio-level considerations. This is common for industries like aerospace and defense, automotive, and government, where the large solution--not portfolio governance--is the primary concern.

* Lean Budgets
  Lean Budgets is a set of practices that minimize overhead by funding and empowering Value Streams rethar than projects while maintaining financial and fitness-for-use governance. This is archieved through objective evaluation of working system, active management of Epic investments, and dynamic budget adjustments.
